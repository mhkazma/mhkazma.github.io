Iâ€™m **Mohamad Kazma**, a PhD student in Civil & Environmental Engineering at Vanderbilt University.  
My research focuses on water distribution networks, nonlinear dynamics, sensor placement, and system observability.

I am particularly interested in combining control theory, graph-based methods, and environmental applications to improve sensor optimization strategies in real-world water infrastructure.
